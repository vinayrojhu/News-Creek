#ISRO

The **Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)**, abbreviated as **ISRO**, is India's national space agency. It operates as the primary research and development arm of the **Department of Space (DoS)**. The DoS is directly overseen by the **Prime Minister of India**, while the **Chairman of ISRO** also serves as the executive of the DoS¬π. Here are some key points about ISRO:

1. **Formation and History**:

   - In **1972**, the Indian government set up the **Space Commission** and the **Department of Space**, bringing ISRO under its purview.
   - This institutionalized space research activities in India, and ISRO has since been managed by the DoS¬π.

2. **Achievements and Capabilities**:
   - ISRO is one of the **six government space agencies** globally with full launch capabilities, cryogenic engines, extraterrestrial missions, and a large fleet of artificial satellites.
   - It is also one of the **four government space agencies** capable of soft landings (uncrewed missions)¬π.
   - ISRO's milestones include launching India's first satellite, **Aryabhata**, in **1975**, and achieving orbital launches with the **Satellite Launch Vehicle-3 (SLV-3)** in **1980**.
   - The agency has developed medium-lift launch vehicles, rocket engines, satellite systems, and networks, enabling it to launch hundreds of domestic and foreign satellites and conduct deep space missions.
   - ISRO has sent **three missions to the Moon** and one to **Mars**¬π.

3. **Significance and Impact**:
   - ISRO's programs have played a crucial role in **India's socio-economic development**.
   - The agency supports both **civilian and military domains**, including disaster management, telemedicine, navigation, and reconnaissance missions.
   - Its spin-off technologies have led to innovations in India's engineering and medical industries¬π.

In summary, ISRO stands at the forefront of space exploration, technological advancements, and scientific achievements, contributing significantly to India's progress and global scientific endeavors¬π. üöÄüåè.
